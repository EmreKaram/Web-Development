/**
 * SQL (Structured Query Language) - Detailed Note
 * 
 * Introduction:
 * SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a powerful language designed for managing, querying, and manipulating relational databases. It is a standard language for interacting with databases and is widely used in various industries for data management.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Relational Databases:
 * SQL is primarily used with relational databases, which organize data in tables with rows and columns. These tables can be related to each other through common fields, forming relationships.
 * 
 * 2. Tables:
 * Tables are the fundamental structure in a relational database. They consist of rows (records) and columns (fields) which hold specific data.
 * 
 * 3. Data Types:
 * SQL supports various data types like integers, decimals, strings, dates, and more. These define the kind of data that can be stored in a particular column.
 * 
 * 4. Queries:
 * SQL allows users to write queries to retrieve specific data from a database. The SELECT statement is used for this purpose.
 * 
 * 5. CRUD Operations:
 * SQL supports four main operations on data:
 * - Create (INSERT)
 * - Read (SELECT)
 * - Update (UPDATE)
 * - Delete (DELETE)
 * 
 * 6. Joins:
 * Joins allow for combining data from multiple tables based on related columns. Common types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.
 * 
 * 7. Aggregation Functions:
 * SQL provides functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX for performing calculations on groups of data.
 * 
 * 8. Constraints:
 * Constraints are rules applied to columns to enforce data integrity. Examples include primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.
 * 
 * 9. Indexes:
 * Indexes are used to optimize query performance by allowing faster retrieval of data from a table.
 * 
 * 10. Subqueries:
 * Subqueries are queries embedded within another query. They are useful for performing complex operations and filtering data.
 * 
 * 11. Transactions:
 * Transactions ensure data integrity by grouping multiple SQL statements into a single unit. They are either committed (saved) or rolled back (undone) as a whole.
 * 
 * Common SQL Commands:
 * - CREATE DATABASE: Used to create a new database.
 * - CREATE TABLE: Creates a new table in the database.
 * - INSERT INTO: Adds new records into a table.
 * - SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
 * - UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.
 * - DELETE FROM: Removes records from a table.
 * - JOIN: Combines records from two or more tables.
 * - GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
 * - HAVING: Filters records returned by GROUP BY.
 * - ORDER BY: Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.
