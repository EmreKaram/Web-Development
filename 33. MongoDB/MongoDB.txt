Databases and Collections:

In MongoDB, data is stored in databases within collections.
To view existing databases, you can use the command show dbs.
To switch to a database, use the command use database_name. (If the database doesn't exist, a new one will be created.)

To create a collection: db.createCollection("collection_name")
To view existing collections: show collections
To delete a collection: db.collection_name.drop()
Adding and Updating Documents:

To add a new document: db.collection_name.insert({ field1: value1, field2: value2, ... })
To update a document: db.collection_name.update({ criteria }, { new_values })
Querying Documents:

To view all documents: db.collection_name.find()
To view documents that meet specific criteria: db.collection_name.find({ field: value })
Deleting Documents:

To delete documents that meet specific criteria: db.collection_name.remove({ field: value })
Closing MongoDB Shell:

To close the Shell, you can use the command exit.
Other Commands:
