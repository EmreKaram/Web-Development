 * SQL vs NoSQL: A Detailed Comparison
 * 
 * Introduction:
 * SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL are two distinct types of database management systems, each designed to handle data differently. Understanding the differences between them is crucial for making informed decisions in database selection.
 * 
 * SQL (Relational Databases):
 * 1. Data Structure:
 *    - Tabular Structure: Data is stored in tables with predefined schemas.
 *    - Structured Data: Each record in a table has a specific format defined by the table's schema.
 * 2. Scalability:
 *    - Vertical Scalability: Scaling up by increasing the power of a single machine.
 *    - Can be limited in scalability due to hardware constraints.
 * 3. Schema:
 *    - Predefined Schema: Requires a predefined schema which enforces data integrity.
 *    - Changes to schema can be complex and may require downtime.
 * 4. Transactions:
 *    - ACID Transactions: Full support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
 *    - Suitable for applications where data integrity is critical.
 * 5. Complex Queries:
 *    - Joins: Relational databases excel in handling complex queries involving multiple tables.
 * 
 * NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases):
 * 1. Data Structure:
 *    - Variety of Data Models: Can store structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data.
 *    - Documents, Key-Value Pairs, Graphs, etc.
 * 2. Scalability:
 *    - Horizontal Scalability: Achieved by adding more servers to a distributed database.
 *    - Designed for scalability with sharding and clustering.
 * 3. Schema:
 *    - Dynamic Schema: No predefined schema; allows for flexible data models.
 *    - Well-suited for projects with evolving or unpredictable data structures.
 * 4. Transactions:
 *    - BASE Transactions: Emphasizes performance and scalability over strict consistency.
 *    - May not provide strict ACID compliance.
 * 5. Complex Queries:
 *    - May not support complex joins as well as SQL databases.
 *    - Optimized for specific types of queries or data access patterns.
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * SQL Databases:
 * - Structured Data: Best suited for applications with well-defined data structures.
 * - Transactions: Critical for applications requiring strict data integrity (e.g., financial systems).
 * 
 * NoSQL Databases:
 * - Unstructured or Semi-Structured Data: Ideal for handling large volumes of varied data.
 * - Highly Scalable: Well-suited for applications with rapidly growing data.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * SQL Databases:
 * - MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, OracleDB, SQL Server.
 * 
 * NoSQL Databases:
 * - MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, Amazon DynamoDB.
 * 
 * Conclusion:
 * Choosing between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific needs of the project.
 * Consider factors like data structure, scalability requirements, and the nature of queries expected.
 * Hybrid approaches or specialized databases can also be used to combine the strengths of both.
